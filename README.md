> [!NOTE]
> ### 🌟 Welcome to OmenCtl (v1.5.0 Release)
> **OmenCtl** (formerly *OMEN Command Center for Linux*) is a completely re-engineered, native control suite built to bridge the gap between official Windows tools and Linux. By combining low-level ACPI/WMI registers with beautiful, modern GTK4 interface designs, OmenCtl gives you full dominion over your laptop.
> 
> **Here is what OmenCtl accomplishes for your laptop:**
> * **🌪️ Silent & Stable Fans:** Re-engineered with a 15-sample moving average and 4°C deadband. Fans react instantly to thermal spikes but stay calm and silent during minor temperature fluctuations. No more constant fan pulsing/revving!
> * **⚡ Zero-Delay Power Profiles:** Instantly toggle direct hardware power profiles (Saver, Balanced, Performance) without any PolicyKit authentication popups or D-Bus lockups.
> * **🌈 Zero-overhead Keyboard RGB:** Full hex color zoning and lighting effects utilizing a specialized animation engine that consumes exactly **0% CPU** on static states.
> * **🎮 Seamless GPU MUX Controls:** Easily switch between Hybrid, Discrete, and Integrated graphics modes with envycontrol, supergfxctl, or prime-select backends.
> * **📊 Beautiful Telemetry:** Gorgeous radial dials and mechanical meters showing real-time CPU/GPU loads, disk usage, and temperature details.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🌪️ Stable & Silent Fan Control
* **High-Fidelity Instruments:** Gorgeous mechanical radial speedometer gauges showing real-time CPU/GPU loads, frequencies, fan RPMs, battery status, and disk utilization.
* **Stable Hysteresis Algorithm:** Re-engineered fan controller with a **15-sample moving average history** and a **4.0°C cooling hysteresis deadband**. The fans react instantly to cool your system but remain locked at speed during slight CPU temperature drops, preventing annoying fan speed pulsing/triggering sounds.
* **RPM Jitter Filter:** Filters out small speed adjustments under a 400 RPM threshold for quiet, stable acoustics.
* **Custom Curve Editor:** Precise drag-and-drop spline editor letting you design custom temperature-to-speed curves with interactive grid snap.

### ⚡ WMI Hardware-First Power Profiles
* **Dynamic hp-wmi Capsule:** The power profiles segment automatically queries your WMI bus and builds buttons matching the exact parameters supported by your laptop (e.g. `power-saver`, `balanced`, `performance`). No hardcoded or mismatched buttons.
* **Hardware-First Sync:** Queries the direct ACPI/WMI hardware registers (`/sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile`) as the primary source of truth, guaranteeing instant, uncached profile synchronization.
* **PPD Polkit-Free Transitions:** Integrated the `powerprofilesctl` tool natively under our root microservice, bypassing complex D-Bus and PolicyKit `AccessDenied` write locks.
* **cTGP & PPAB Boost paths:** Automatically locks CPU and GPU boost rails (Configurable TGP & PPAB) at the hardware level when performance mode is engaged.

### 🎨 Premium Dynamic Themes
* **Theme-Adaptive Visuals:** High-contrast Dark and Light modes. Gauges, radial rings, and capsule buttons dynamically invert their colors, tracks, and borders to offer premium visual excellence.
* **Performance-Reactive Accents:** The global theme accent color reacts dynamically to your active performance profile (glowing emerald for Power Saver, HP red for Balanced, and electric purple for Performance).

### 🌈 RGB Lighting Customization
* **4-Zone Keyboard Control:** Full hex color customization per zone.
* **Dazzling Animation Modes:** Static, Breathing, Wave, and Cycle effects.
* **Zero-CPU Animation Engine:** Parked animations thread locks at exactly **0% CPU** for static colors and uses precise signal polling for active animations to keep your laptop serenely cool.

### 🎮 GPU MUX Switch
* Seamless graphics mode switching between **Hybrid (Optimus)**, **Discrete (Dedicated GPU)**, and **Integrated (Intel/AMD iGPU)**.
* Built-in backends supporting `envycontrol`, `supergfxctl`, and `prime-select`.
